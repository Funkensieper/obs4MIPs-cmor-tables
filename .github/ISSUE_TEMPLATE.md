"registration information for [acronym describing your dataset - see source_id below]"

The following are required registered content: 1) institution, 2) institution_id, 3) source, 4) source_id and 5) source_label



'institution' -- Full name and address of institution, likely to include: laboratory/group name, hosting institution name, city, state/province and postal-code, country (no restriction on character set).
'institution_id' -- Short acronym suitable for search interfaces and sub-directory names (should limit the characters used to the following set: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and "-") 
'source' -- Used to fully identify the observational product and version.  The first portion of the ?source? attribute records an acronym and version number identifying the dataset (like you might expect to see in labeling a graphed curve constructed from the data).   This is followed by the "release year" in parentheses followed by a colon and then a longer title describing the dataset. 
'source_id' -- The same as the first part of source (before the release year), but with certain forbidden characters replaced by hyphens. The source_id (and source_label) must be constructed from the following limited character set:  a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and the hyphen ("-").
'source_label' -- The same as the source_id but without the version.  The source_id (and source_label) must be constructed from the following limited character set:  a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and the hyphen ("-").


Examples:


Example 1: [title your issue "institution_id registration of PCMDI"]

institution_id = PCMDI
institution = Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA 94550, USA

Example 2: [title your issue "institution_id registration of NASA-GISS"]

institution_id = NASA-GISS
institution = NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, New York, NY 10025, USA 


You can now delete the two examples and submit your issue!
