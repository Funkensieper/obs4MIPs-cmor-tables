To register (or edit) some or all of the obs4MIPs "registered content", please title this issue as follows:  

"registration information for [acronym describing your dataset - see source_id below]"

The following are required registered content: 1) institution_id, and 2) source_id

'institution_id' -- Short acronym suitable for search interfaces and sub-directory names (should limit the characters used to the following set: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and "-"), along with full name and address of institution, likely to include: laboratory/group name, hosting institution name, city, state/province and postal-code, country (no restriction on character set).
 
'source_id' -- The same as the first part of source (before the release year), but with certain forbidden characters replaced by hyphens. The source_id (and source_label) must be constructed from the following limited character set: a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and the hyphen ("-").

Example: institution_id registration [with issue titled "registration of PCMDI"]

"PCMDI":"Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA 94550, USA"

Example: source_id registration [with issue titled "registration of REMSS-PRW-6-6-0"]

"REMSS-PRW-6-6-0":{
  "description":"Precipitable Water",
  "institution_id":"RSS",
  "label":"REMSS PRW 6.6.0",
  "region":"global",
  "release_year":"2017",
  "source_id":"REMSS-PRW-6-6-0",
  "source_label":"REMSS-PRW", # The same as the source_id but without the version
  "source_type":"satellite_blended"
}
