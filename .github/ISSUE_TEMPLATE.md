To register (or edit) some or all of the obs4MIPs "registered content", please title this issue as follows:  

"registration information for [acronym describing your dataset - see source_id below]"

The following are required registered content: 1) institution, 2) institution_id, 3) source, 4) source_id and 5) source_label

'institution' -- Full name and address of institution, likely to include: laboratory/group name, hosting institution name, city, state/province and postal-code, country (no restriction on character set).

'institution_id' -- Short acronym suitable for search interfaces and sub-directory names (should limit the characters used to the following set: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and "-").
 
'source' -- Used to fully identify the observational product and version.  The first portion of the ?source? attribute records an acronym and version number identifying the dataset (like you might expect to see in labeling a graphed curve constructed from the data).   This is followed by the "release year" in parentheses followed by a colon and then a longer title describing the dataset. 
 
'source_id' -- The same as the first part of source (before the release year), but with certain forbidden characters replaced by hyphens. The source_id (and source_label) must be constructed from the following limited character set:  a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and the hyphen ("-").

'source_label' -- The same as the source_id but without the version.  The source_id (and source_label) must be constructed from the following limited character set:  a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and the hyphen ("-").

Examples:


Example 1: [with issue titled "registration of ARC-SST"]

institution_id = "ESA CCI" 
institution = "European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative" 
source = "ARC SST v1.1 (2015): Along-Track-Scanning-Radiometer Reprocessing for Climate (ARC) Sea Surface Temperature (SST)"
source_id = "ARC-SST-v1-1"
source_label = "ARC-SST"

Please modify the example to include the registered content about your dataset and submit this issue.   Indicate in your issue title if you are modifying your input or not providing a complete set of registered content.
